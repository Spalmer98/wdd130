    <h2>Spencer Palmer</h2>
    <p>I'm 25 years old and I'm majoring in Software Engineering. This is my 3rd year of college, but only my 2nd year at BYU-I.</p> 
    <p>I was born and raised in Idaho Falls, Idaho and am currently staying with my parents for this semester. I mostly spend my free time either online with friends or watching a movie with my family. I'm currently a part-time assistant manager at a retail store in Ammon, Idaho.</p> 
    <p>I've never been interested in web development because it always seemed boring to me. After taking a few corses that lightly touched on web development I've grown to enjoy playing around in html and browsing source code on webpages. I know that having knowlegde and skill in web development will be benefitial to my future career.</p>
