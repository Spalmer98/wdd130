      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will contain the specials of the day or week, along with information on locations and new things coming to the restaurant. The home page will focus on grabbing the attention of future and current customers with the goal of pushing items and deals that the restaurant wants people to buy. It would also be a great place to put customer reviews to help persuade future customers that the food and services provided are good and worth experiencing. The first thing right under the header will be a large box that cycles through deals and items that are popular which will contain photos of the items. After that will be a place that will help the user find the locations of the restaurants and a place that will show customer reviews. It will have a header containing clickable navigation links to the other pages along with a phone number for the restaurant store. There will also be a footer containing the copyright and social media links. The social media links will use the logo icon for the site and be clickable. The footer will also have a corporate phone number to contact customer support.

      </ul>
      <h3>Menu</h3>
      <p>
        There will be a new page for all the menu items and their prices along with descriptions of what each dishâ€™s ingredients are and any other information the customers may want to know about the food the restaurant sells. It will be centered on the screen and all items will have their own box with a background, image, and boarder. In the future it might be good to add a type of drop-down menu of sorts to show the nutritional facts of each item if the user clicks on the nutritional facts text under each item. The image on each menu item will be offset slightly from the rest of the box to add some flair to the page and help the website stand out. There will be a header containing clickable navigation links to the other pages along with a phone number for the restaurant store. There will also be a footer containing the copyright and social media links. The social media links will use the logo icon for the site and be clickable. The footer will also have a corporate phone number to contact customer support.

      </ul>
      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        About US page will have information about the restaurant and the people who run it so that customers can get better acquainted with the business and hopefully gain a sense of trust with the business. I want it to contain photos of the staff and some information about how the restaurant got started. It will contain a separate spot for the owner and founders along with a spot for the head of the kitchen. It should look appealing to the eye and help customers feel comfortable with the people involved at the establishment. It will have a header containing clickable navigation links to the other pages along with a phone number for the restaurant store. There will also be a footer containing the copyright and social media links. The social media links will use the logo icon for the site and be clickable. The footer will also have a corporate phone number to contact customer support.

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        The contact us page will have a text box for the user to input suggestions or a review that will be sent to the management of the restaurant. Above the text box will be another smaller text box for the user to enter their name and right below that will be a text box for the user to enter a small description of what will be in the main text box. There will be a submit button below the text box and once submitted the user will receive a thank you message. There will be a header containing clickable navigation links to the other pages along with a phone number for the restaurant store. There will also be a footer containing the copyright and social media links. The social media links will use the logo icon for the site and be clickable. The footer will also have a corporate phone number to contact customer support.
